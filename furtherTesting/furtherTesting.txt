I kinda wish that git-bash had emacs instead of vim.
While I was in school I only used emacs and thought that would be enough.
Instead, here I am in vim.
I already miss ctl-n, ctl-p, ctl-f, ctl-b.
Certain keyboard commands will always feel like home and right now I feel like
I'm in a strangers house using vim.
