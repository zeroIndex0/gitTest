I kinda wish that git-bash had emacs instead of vim.
While I was in school I only used emacs and thought that would be enough.
Instead, here I am in vim.
I already miss ctl-n, ctl-p, ctl-f, ctl-b.
Certain keyboard commands will always feel like home and right now I feel like
I'm in a strangers house using vim.

testing out git commit

git is actually quite nice for uploading content.
After everything is set up it's much faster than uploading files  
and it's nice to be back in a terminal


This update is just me setting up git-bash on another machine  
testing out changes  
How will this look?


I really do wish that pushing code to a private repo at least showed that you added something to github.
But sadly, it does not. So if you are working on code in a private repo and it takes a few weeks to smooth things out.
Well, then you are just going to have a few weeks of nothing to show.  Which is kind of not so great depending on your situation.
I suppose that you could cheese green boxes by doing that, but still, if someone were to glance at your profile, they would think you havent added anything.
Where in reality, you just spent a week implementing a feature to the code in your private repo.
So, at this point, im almost forced to make my repo public, or stop working on my private repo.
what an annoying hassle not having a job in the industry creates for a private repo.
"I know you like working on this side project, but........."  This is kind of a rant, which I didn't intend for this to be a rant.
I just wanted to say: Pushing code to a private repo doesnt show those contributions publically.  That's all.
