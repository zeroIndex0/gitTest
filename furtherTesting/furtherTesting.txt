testing out git commit

git is actually quite nice for uploading content.
After everything is set up it's much faster than uploading files  
and it's nice to be back in a terminal


This update is just me setting up git-bash on another machine  
testing out changes  
How will this look?


I really do wish that pushing code to a private repo at least showed that you added something to github.
But sadly, it does not. So if you are working on code in a private repo and it takes a few weeks to smooth things out.
Well, then you are just going to have a few weeks of nothing to show.  Which is kind of not so great depending on your situation.
What I was trying to say: Pushing code to a private repo doesnt show those contributions publically.
