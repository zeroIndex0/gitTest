I kinda wish that git-bash had emacs instead of vim.
While I was in school I only used emacs and thought that would be enough.
Instead, here I am in vim.
I already miss ctl-n, ctl-p, ctl-f, ctl-b.
Certain keyboard commands will always feel like home and right now I feel like
I'm in a strangers house using vim.

testing out git commit

git is actually quite nice for uploading content.
After everything is set up it's much faster than uploading files  
and it's nice to be back in a terminal


This update is just me setting up git-bash on another machine
